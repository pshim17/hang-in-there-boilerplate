The project uses HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. 

Learning goal:
-Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code 
-Write clean, DRY JavaScript 
  -Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP 
  -Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM 
  -Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM 
-Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of html, css, and javascript and how they work together to create website. I spent the most time with coming up with a logic for deleting an unmotivational poster when clicking on the image, title, quote, and background. I, also, had issues with navigating away from unmotivational posters view after deleting some posters and those posters should still be gone when returning to the view. I reached out to my Rock for help, attended office hours, and went in huddles w/ my cohort mates for ideas.
